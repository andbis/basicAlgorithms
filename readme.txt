For introductory assignment in Data Mining

Algorithms used:
	Apriori - frequent pattern mining
	K-NN - nearest neighbour
	K-Means - clustering, unsupervised

Included in this folder should be the following files: 
	run.py - Script file that should be run 
	library.py - Python library file containing all functions used 
	Data Mining - Spring 2018.csv - data - included because it's only 66KB

Following has been uploaded separately: run.pdf - Report of experiments

IMPORTANT: It's assumed that file 'Data Mining - Spring 2018.csv' is in the same directory as run.py and library.py, otherwise data won't be found. 

Program has been developed and tested on following setup: 
OSX: 10.13.3
Python: 3.6.3 - Anaconda build
	Packages used: 
		Matplotlib
		Numpy
		Pandas
		Math
		Collections.counter


In addition to what the script file run.py will print, it will also save two figures in the directory.
